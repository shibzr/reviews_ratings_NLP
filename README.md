# Predicting Reviews Rating using Natural Language Processing (NLP) under RandomForest Calssifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi_Layer Neural Networks
## Packages: Sklearn, tensorflow, keras

The Multi_Layer Neural Network produces RMSE = 0.70 & Rsquare = 67.4%

For examplel, a review of "employees are nice but very expensive" produces a rating of 3.63

Word Clouds for words of highest and lowest ratings are also generated using WordCloud package.
